This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Dependencies are locked with a `yarn.lock` file, so please use `yarn` and not `npm` for installing them.

## eft-collab-maps (Escape From Tarkov Collaborative Maps)

A web app built with NextJS and Pusher to point out locations and plan routes in real time with a squad in Escape From Tarkov. Simply enter a room number and share the resulting URL with your friends, when you draw, add shapes, or type on the screen, your team members should be able to see it too.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
